          Unlike his brother Darius, victory in battle was never enough for
          Draven. He craved recognition, acclaim, and glory. He first sought
          greatness in the Noxian military, but his flair for the dramatic went
          severely underappreciated. Thirsting for a method to share ''Draven''
          with the world, he turned his attention to the prison system. There he
          carved out the celebrity he desired by turning the tedious affair of
          executions into a premiere spectacle.

          At Draven's first execution, he shocked onlookers when he ordered the
          doomed prisoner to run for dear life. Just before the man managed to
          flee from sight, Draven brought him down with a flawless throw of his
          axe. Soon, all Draven's executions became a gauntlet through which
          Noxian prisoners raced for a final chance at life. He used this trial
          as his own personal stage, and turned executions into a leading form
          of entertainment. He rallied onlookers into a frenzy, while desperate
          prisoners scrambled to evade him. They never succeeded. Rejecting the
          solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners Draven donned bright
          outfits and developed flashy signature moves to distinguish himself.
          Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances
          spread quickly. As his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated
          ego. He belonged at the center of attention. Before long, the scope of
          his ambitions outgrew the population of Noxus. He decided that the
          glorious exploits of Draven should be put on display for the entire
          world.
