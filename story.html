        <p class="drop--cap">Let me tell you about my glade.</p>
        <p>
          On a clear night—like this night, in fact—when the moon is full and
          ripe, silver light glitters on star-shaped leaves with hair-fine
          fronds like threads of silk, and night-blooming Seleneia render my
          glade a magical wonderland.
        </p>
        <p>
          A traveler might catch the scent of far distant continents on the
          wind. Only hints, to be sure, but such hints! A bouquet of desert
          spices, sun-baked stone, and salt from the crests of racing waves,
          mingled with the evergreen sap-scent of highland firs. You might think
          such a turn of phrase overly whimsical, words that might tumble from
          the lips of a hopeless romantic, or a lovelorn poet. You’d be right,
          of course, but that doesn’t make them any less true.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while we’re on the subject of romantics—an artistic soul might, if
          they came here at just the right time, see dancing patterns in the
          moonglow dappling through the forest canopy. Their eye might follow it
          around, gradually sensing an order to the play of light and shadow
          across the bark of a tree, or in the ripples upon a pool of water. A
          pattern that almost looks like it might just form a doorway of sorts,
          if only it would complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no matter how those patterns swirl and dance, they never fully
          coalesce into a whole. Almost never, that is. After all, the magic of
          these lands is skittish—with good reason—and doesn’t reveal its
          secrets to just anyone. We nature spirits are drawn to places like
          this. They nurture us, as we in turn nurture them. You can find us all
          over the world—in some places more than others, yes, but if there’s
          magic bubbling up, like as not you’ll find a spirit like me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flatter myself that the glade I inhabit is more infused with it than
          most other places in this land that mortals call Noxus—if you know the
          right way to look. Most of this world’s inhabitants have forgotten how
          to see, how to <i>really</i> see, but there are others, a whole race
          of them, in fact, who never forgot. They’re called yordles, and
          they’re not <i>exactly</i> from this world. I’m friends with a lot of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two of them are approaching now. It sounds like they’re trying to get
          back to their kin, but they’re having trouble with the—for want of a
          better word—key that’s supposed to help them find their way home. You
          see, the low roads <i>they</i> travel don’t run on the surface of this
          world. Nor do they travel straight, like those of the men who call the
          lands hereabouts home. They curve and loop, swirling all around the
          place like a crazy knot you can’t ever untie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most yordles know how to travel them relatively easily, but these two?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s just say they’re not the best-suited traveling companions. I can
          hear them, just beyond the spirit veil, bickering like a pair of
          hungry foxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’ll be here soon, but I wonder if they know they’re not the only
          ones approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mortals are coming this way. Warriors. Armored in steel and stone,
          bearing instruments of death. I don’t like them, but don’t
          misunderstand my reasons. I understand death is necessary, a vital
          part of the natural cycle of being, but these people only take, and
          don’t give back. They pave over the land with roads that do not curve.
          They use their axes and saws to clear the land of growing things. They
          are an empire of angles and order. Nearby trees bend away from them in
          response, but they don’t notice, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mortals almost always miss their impact on the world around them.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p class="drop--cap">
          A woman with long brown hair is the first to enter my wooded glade.
          She taps spurred heels to her horse’s flanks, and rides in a circle,
          scanning the treeline and ground for signs of life that might mean her
          harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes are cold, and she surveys the beauty of the trees like a
          woodsman sharpening an axe.
        </p>
        <p>
          She halts her mount in the middle of the glade and sits in silence.
          She hears birdsong, the sighing of the forest, and the burbling stream
          flowing over time-smoothed rocks. Most people who come here are calmed
          by these sounds, their souls replenished simply by being in nature.
        </p>
        <p>But not her.</p>
        <p>
          None of the forest’s energy touches her, and I don’t know whether to
          feel sad or angry. The woman is patient, and only after several
          minutes pass does she lift her arm and spread her fingers wide.
          Moments later, a dozen riders appear at the edge of the glade. Their
          horses are exhausted, flanks lathered white and heads bowed. These
          animals have carried their riders a great distance, so I extend a
          little magic into their tired limbs. They whinny and toss their manes
          in gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mustachioed man clad in leather and furs rides towards the woman. A
          bronze circlet holds his long dark hair from his face, and his tunic
          has been cut to show off his muscular build. A wolf-pelt cloak mantles
          his shoulders, and a pair of circle-grip axes are slung at his back.
          Like the woman, his gaze makes me fear what he might do to the trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I think I dislike him even more than the woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What took you so long, Tamara?” he says. “Afraid we’ll be ambushed?”
        </p>
        <p>
          She ignores his questions. “We should make camp here, Draven. Fresh
          water and plentiful wood. It’s broad and wide, too, so there’s limited
          avenues of approach.”
        </p>
        <p>“Spoken like a true Noxian warmason.”</p>
        <p>“You say that like it’s a bad thing.”</p>
        <p>
          She slides from her saddle, and as soon as her boots hit the ground, I
          recoil from the stone in her veins, the iron in her soul. The sounds
          in the glade dim, but none of the humans notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I want to reach the capital before we die of old age,” says Draven.
          “The fighting in Basilich was fun, but I need to get back to the arena
          and put these axes to good use.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You also want to go back and tell Darius you’d rather his army
          advance <i>without</i> a warmason carefully scouting the way?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “We’re in no danger,” says Draven. “Not in the empire’s heartland.”
        </p>
        <p>
          She folds her arms. “You heard what happened to Wintory outside
          Drekan?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “No,” shrugs Draven, “but you’re going to tell me, aren’t you?”
        </p>
        <p>
          She looks at him, then sighs and shakes her head. “What would be the
          point? It’s not about you, so you’re not going to care.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I listen to them trade insults back and forth, but am confused at how
          the words they say don’t match the shimmering colors of their auras.
          It’s a source of great confusion to me that mortals spend so much time
          saying things they do not mean, and feeling things they do not
          express.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s an honesty to nature—albeit a bloody one—you can count on.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="drop--cap">It’s nightfall when the yordles get here.</p>
        <p>
          I feel the irresistible call of their key, and push a little of my
          power into the spirit realm to open the way. One of the silverbark
          trees shifts her branches windward slightly, and the last rays of
          sunset complete a glowing amber pattern on the gnarled knots of her
          mossy trunk. Shadow, light and ridged bark combine to form an endless
          loop that, from a certain angle and a certain height, looks like a
          portal into a land of eternal sunrise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whispers and song echo from the arbor in the heart of the tree. The
          Noxians are busy with their horses, and the animals make enough noise
          that the humans don’t hear it. It sounds like the winds are speaking,
          passing secrets between the trees. Maybe they are—you can never really
          know what the winds are saying. Well, maybe the blue bird of the seas
          knows, but she doesn’t roam far from the sunken city these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grass around the base of the silverbark ripples in a warm breeze
          that carries a multitude of stories from another realm. I’ve heard
          hundreds of them, but the yordles have an inexhaustible supply, and I
          never tire of learning of their travels.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s a soft pop of air, like a bubble bursting on the surface of a
          lake…
        </p>
        <p>
          …and two diminutive forms tumble out from the tree. They roll into the
          high grass, looking surprised to find themselves in a forest glade.
          One of them immediately picks herself up, and brings her big cannon to
          bear. She spins around. Left then right. She draws a bead on a rabbit
          with a half-chewed ear, poking a twitching nose from its burrow.
        </p>
        <p>“Did you do this?” she asks.</p>
        <p>
          The rabbit doesn’t answer. But then rabbits are stoic. You want a
          secret kept, but have to tell <i>someone</i>? Tell a rabbit, they’ll
          take it to their grave.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this yordle—she’s called Tristana, and she looks mad. Like
          she’s ready to march off to fight, but forgot which way the war was.
          Her purple skin is flushed a deeper shade than normal, and her white
          hair is swept back in a tight ponytail.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hefts her cannon and aims it towards the rabbit.
        </p>
        <p>It hops forward, unfazed by the threat.</p>
        <p>
          “I won’t ask again,” says Tristana, “and Boomer never misses!”
        </p>
        <p>
          The rabbit twitches its nose, cool as winter frost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana’s traveling companion sits up, a tiny, winged faerie circling
          her head. Ah, Lulu and Pix. Her wild purple hair billows in a wind
          that only seems to affect her, and her tall hat sits at a funny angle.
          It’s slipped over her eyes, and she taps around her with a curling
          stick.
        </p>
        <p>“I’ve gone blind!” she says. “That’s new.”</p>
        <p>
          Tristana keeps her gaze locked on the rabbit, and holds up a hand to
          silence Lulu, but her friend doesn’t see it. Lulu gets up and walks in
          a circle, tapping the ground in front of her. The flowers duck, and
          the buzzing glitterbugs scatter before Pix can pluck their wings.
          Lulu’s faerie companion is cute, but he’s got a strange sort of humor.
          I can’t ever tell if he’s really funny or rude. Maybe it’s both.
        </p>
        <p>“Tristana! Are you there?” says Lulu.</p>
        <p>
          Tristana sighs in exasperation. She taps two fingers to her eyes, then
          points them at the rabbit with a stern look.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’m watching you, flopsy,” she warns. Her jaw drops as she finally
          notices the humans in the glade. She darts over to Lulu and pushes her
          back against the tree. The portal they fell from is already fading as
          the light changes.
        </p>
        <p>“Humans,” she hisses.</p>
        <p>
          “Where?” says Lulu. “It’s all dark! But then, sometimes I see more
          with my eyes closed.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana sighs, and pulls the brim of Lulu’s hat up.
        </p>
        <p>Lulu blinks, and hugs Tristana.</p>
        <p>“It’s a miracle!”</p>
        <p>
          “Quiet,” hisses Tristana, and Pix darts down to zap a tiny spike of
          violet light at her cheek.
        </p>
        <p>Tristana bats the faerie away with a grimace.</p>
        <p>
          I bend the shadows around the trees a little. Humans sometimes have a
          hard time seeing yordles, at least as they <i>really</i> are, but I
          think the woman with the cold eyes might be sharper than most, and I
          don’t want to see these two get hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana glances around the tree. The Noxians are making camp, but I’m
          relieved to see they’re not lighting a fire. Draven is grumbling about
          that, but Tamara is adamant they not broadcast their presence. I make
          sure all the wood in this glade is green and not good for fires.
          Doesn’t stop everyone who comes this way from trying their luck with
          an axe or saw… but most of them.
        </p>
        <p>Tristana nods to herself.</p>
        <p>“They haven’t seen us,” she whispers. “Good.”</p>
        <p>
          “They look friendly,” says Lulu, peeking over Tristana’s shoulder. “I
          think we should say hello.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “They’re Noxians,” replies Tristana, and I feel her exasperation. “You
          don’t talk to Noxians unless you want to lose your head.”
        </p>
        <p>“Why? Do they like collecting heads?”</p>
        <p>
          Tristana rolls her eyes, finally taking the time to examine her
          surroundings. I lift up some flowers and wave to her. She can’t help
          but feel the magic in the glade, and waves back. Some people say
          Tristana’s all business, and so very serious, but I know better.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looks up at the tree and gives it an experimental rap with her
          knuckles. She taps gently around the bark, before finally hearing a
          booming echo from deep inside the tree. Some of the Noxians look up,
          and she winces. I creak some branches, and persuade the water to
          splash playfully over the rocks. The Noxians return to their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana nods and says, “Thanks,” before turning back to Lulu and
          asking, “Right, where’s the whispering key?”
        </p>
        <p>“The what-now?”</p>
        <p>
          “The thing we’ve been using to travel through all the portals…”
        </p>
        <p>“Remind me, what did it look like?”</p>
        <p>
          “It looked a little like a compass made of carved stone.”
        </p>
        <p>“Oh, you mean my <i>doodad</i>.”</p>
        <p>
          “Your…,” begins Tristana before settling on, “Yes. That’s what I
          mean.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu does a pirouette and pats herself down, checking pockets that
          seem to appear and disappear at random. She closes one eye, and bites
          her lip, pulling out coins, dice, chips of precious stones and
          glittering fluff. But nothing resembling a key.
        </p>
        <p>“I just had it.”</p>
        <p>
          “Yes, you did,” agrees Tristana through gritted teeth. “You used it to
          open the portal on the beach while we were running from that pack of
          cragwolves, after we’d dropped in on Poppy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I like Poppy, but she’s so serious,” says Lulu, stomping around as if
          she’s marching on a parade ground. She pauses to stare at Tristana.
          “Wait! Are you and her actually the <i>same</i> yordle?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “No, of course we’re not,” sighs Tristana. “Now, will you hurry up,
          please?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “You <i>could</i> be, you know. Same hair, and that little furrow just
          above your nose when you get mad. See, there it is!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting angry with Lulu won’t do any good. It would be like chasing a
          cub that’s stolen your shoe; it’s all part of a fun game. I send a
          cooling breeze to ruffle Tristana’s white hair, but it doesn’t seem to
          help.
        </p>
        <p>
          “The whispering… I mean, your doodad? Can you just get it for me?”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Oh, right, yes, I was looking for that, wasn’t I?”
        </p>
        <p>“Yes. Yes, you were.”</p>
        <p>
          Lulu sighs, making a theatrical show of befuddlement. She looks up at
          the darkening sky and snaps her fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          “No wonder I can’t find it,” she says. “It’s too dark!”
        </p>
        <p>
          She lifts her crooked staff, and Tristana’s eyes widen as she realizes
          what Lulu’s about to do. But it’s too late to stop her.
        </p>
        <p>
          A stream of glitter bursts from the end of Lulu’s staff and explodes
          like a swarm of dancing fireflies overhead. The glade is bathed in the
          glow of a thousand stars and a secret gathering of moons.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Aha!” says Lulu, finally pulling out something from a fold in her
          tunic. It looks like a cross between a budding seedpod and a curling
          seashell. A rainbow of colorful lines swirls on its surface, and what
          look like tiny tadpoles swim inside it. “Here it is.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana looks horrified as the light from Lulu’s staff floods the
          glade, but before she can react, a spinning axe blade flashes between
          the two of them and buries itself in the bark of the tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu almost jumps out of her skin, and the seedpod-seashell flies from
          her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silverbark cries out in pain, so I pour magic up through her roots
          and into the heartwood. Vivid amber sap oozes from the gouge in the
          wounded tree’s bark, pinning the axe in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu’s doodad sails through the air to land somewhere in the middle of
          the glade. It rolls into the tall grass, and I feel its primal
          energies pulse outwards in a rippling wave.
        </p>
        <p>“Oops,” says Lulu.</p>
        <p>
          A veritable flurry of black-shafted arrows slices through the
          undergrowth as the Noxians respond the only way they know how.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Get back!” shouts Tristana, swinging Boomer around and dragging Lulu
          away to find cover behind a moldy log covered in moss and ivy.
        </p>
        <p>
          An arrow punches into the rotten wood. Another splits the night a
          hair’s breadth from Tristana’s ear. Lulu squeals, and Pix darts to
          Tristana’s side. Fresh wildflowers of blue, gold, and crimson
          instantly bloom on the dead wood.
        </p>
        <p>Tristana fires Boomer. <i>Blam, blam, blam! </i></p>
        <p>
          Everyone ducks. Noxians, rabbits, and glitterbugs. Even the worms
          burrow deeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boomer’s cannonballs streak burning streamers across the glade, and
          spouts of water leap from the stream to cool them as they ricochet
          from the rocks. The last thing we want in the glade is a fire!
        </p>
        <p>
          “Spread out!” yells Draven, running to retrieve his axe from the
          silverbark’s trunk.
        </p>
        <p>The Noxians are quick to obey.</p>
        <p>
          Say what you want about the Noxians—and I’ve heard plenty of humans
          passing through my glade who have a <i>lot</i> to say about
          Noxians—they’re disciplined! Tamara runs to her horse and draws a
          slender rapier from a saddle scabbard.
        </p>
        <p>
          She grins at Draven and says, “No chance of an ambush, eh?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Draven shrugs, and his aura gives no sense of any alarm or care at
          being proven wrong. All I sense is glee at the chance to spill blood.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, I <i>definitely</i> dislike him more than Tamara.</p>
        <p>
          The Noxian warriors spread through the glade, moving forward in pairs,
          as archers loose steady volleys of arrows to keep the two yordles from
          moving. I know nothing of war, but even I can see the deadly tactics
          of the Noxians will see Lulu and Tristana dead.
        </p>
        <p>I’m all for fun and games, but I don’t want anyone <i>killed</i>…</p>
        <p>
          Magic surges through the ground in a powerful wave. I weave loops of
          grass that tangle the feet of the first Noxian soldier, a great brute
          of a man with a double-bladed axe. He goes down hard, slicing open his
          arm as he falls flat on his face. His companion trips over him,
          dropping her sword, and the man cries out in pain as it stabs a
          handspan into his buttock.
        </p>
        <p>
          An amberwood tree twists its trunk and whips its willowy branches
          around like a catapult. It smacks a crouching archer in the face, and
          he topples backwards. The arrow he was poised to loose goes straight
          up in the air. A careful gust of wind, and it plunges down between his
          legs, tearing his britches open at the crotch. He yelps in alarm and
          scrambles back on his haunches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana fires again, and Pix jumps onto her head, punching the air
          and shouting squeaking insults with every shot. Flowers fall from the
          air above the tiny faerie, and I see more than one arrow deflected
          around the yordle gunner by their shimmering petals.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Can you see your doodad?” shouts Tristana over the cannon’s noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu spins her staff around, and springs onto its shepherd’s crook
          handle. She shades her eyes with one hand, and peers through the
          fading illumination. An arrow slashes towards her, but the coiled
          point of her hat smacks it from the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Nope, but then I don’t know what it looks like now.”
        </p>
        <p>“What do you mean you <i>don’t know what it looks like now</i>?”</p>
        <p>
          Lulu spins in a spiral down her staff, and daisies spring up around
          her as she lands. “The doodad’s a bit flighty, you see. Every time I
          put it down, it likes to try out a different shape.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana groans as Lulu sends a blazing shaft of sparkling light
          through the trees. A pair of Noxians are hurled through the air. They
          land in the stream, and I immediately mob them with a knot of frogs.
          The tongues of bucket-frogs are coated with slime that will give them
          waking dreams, and ought to send them to the moon and back.
        </p>
        <p>“So it could look like <i>anything</i>?” asks Tristana.</p>
        <p>
          “Pretty much,” agrees Lulu. “Just look for it out of the corner of
          your eye. It only changes if it thinks you’re looking right at it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “I never thought I’d say this, but I wish Heimer was here right now,”
          says Tristana. “We could really use his hex-goggles.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Don’t be silly,” says Lulu. “That’d take all the fun out of this.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana spins on her heel to fire at a Noxian leaping towards her.
          Her cannonball punches him square in the chest and he flies back into
          a thorny bush that suddenly gets a <i>lot</i> more thorny.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Fun?” she says. Then she grins. “You know what, you’re right. Let’s
          have some fun with these numpties. Grab on.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu laughs and throws her arms around Tristana’s neck as if she’s
          about to give her a big sloppy kiss. Tristana fires again, and this
          time her cannon is aimed at the ground. The two yordles erupt from
          behind the flowery, arrow-studded log and arc over the heads of the
          advancing soldiers. The Noxians watch in open-mouthed surprise as the
          two yordles spin over their heads, giggling musically as they go.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who knows what the Noxians are seeing? Something strange, no doubt. A
          yordle’s glamour is an inconstant thing, and even they don’t know how
          others see them most of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gleaming bolts corkscrew from Lulu’s staff, and everywhere they hit,
          Noxians are thrown from their feet in a spray of petals and sparks
          that burn like drops of venom. The two yordles land on the run, and
          while Tristana spins around, firing at any Noxians who rear their
          heads, Lulu scrambles around on all fours in search of her doodad.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Here, doodad,” she whispers to the grass. “Pretty please, with
          sprinkles on top! I’ll let you take us somewhere <i>you</i> want to go
          next.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The doodad—or whatever it’s <i>really</i> called—doesn’t respond, but
          I sense it rolling away from Lulu. Well, not really <i>rolling</i>, as
          such, more <i>making itself be where she isn’t</i>. It’s a thing of
          old and powerful magic, but not without a childish sense of whimsy.
          It’s like it thinks this is a fun game. Perhaps it is, as Lulu is
          laughing with delight, spinning around and bounding through the glade
          like a weasel chasing its own tail as she chases her doodad. It turns
          into a large snail as Lulu gets close to it. And when she takes her
          hand away, sticky, it turns into a puff of light before reappearing
          behind Lulu as a stick-man tottering away on mismatched legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana’s keeping the Noxians’ heads down with a barrage of cannon
          fire. I hear Draven finally wrench his axe from the silverbark, its
          edge all gummy with sap. He turns and moves from cover to cover,
          stalking Tristana like a cat, all taut limbs and steely focus. He
          draws his arm back, ready to throw his other axe.
        </p>
        <p>
          A squadron of buzzing wasps swoops in and swarms him as a battalion of
          angry squirrels drops from the trees. His axe flies wide of the mark,
          thudding back to earth where the Noxian horses used to be. Now there’s
          only a mess of hoofprints and a few discarded saddles. Draven spins
          around in a frenzy, pulling the scratching, biting squirrels from his
          arms and neck. Squirrels are the thugs of the forest. Rabbits might be
          stoic, but squirrels will bite your ear off as soon as your back’s
          turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu’s not even looked up. She’s still running in circles and giggling
          like a child as she shoots puffs of light from her staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an explosive burst of speed, Tamara breaks from cover and runs
          straight for Lulu. I use my magic to throw distractions in her path.
          Frantic moles dig holes before her, but she weaves between their hasty
          traps. The thorny stems of a hookbrush whip at her, but she skids
          under them. She looks around, starting to understand she has another
          enemy here—one she can’t see or fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Gotcha!” cries Lulu, finally grabbing hold of her doodad. Now it
          looks like a knotted bunch of twigs held together by loops of grass
          and spiderwebs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tamara dives over a coiling root I rip up from the earth, and rolls to
          her feet. The last sparkles of Lulu’s starburst gleam on the rapier as
          Tamara pulls it back to strike.
        </p>
        <p>And then Tristana’s there.</p>
        <p>
          She hefts Boomer as if her cannon’s suddenly gotten heavier.
        </p>
        <p>A <i>lot</i> heavier.</p>
        <p>
          “That’s my friend, buster,” she says, and pulls the trigger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The booming thunder of the cannon is deafening, and birds as far away
          as two rivers west take to the sky at the noise. A blazing tongue of
          fire erupts from the muzzle as a giant cannonball blasts out. The
          force of the recoil spins Tristana around, but that’s nothing compared
          to what it does to Tamara.
        </p>
        <p>
          She flies backwards like she’s been punched by an angry stone golem.
          She vanishes into the trees, and I don’t think she’ll be getting up
          any time soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Tristana is hauled from her feet by the scruff of her neck.
          Boomer drops to the earth and Draven holds her up to his face with a
          bemused grin on his scratched and bleeding face.
        </p>
        <p>“Now, what in the name of the Wolf are you?”</p>
        <p>“Put me down, ya big oaf!” yells Tristana.</p>
        <p>
          She kicks and swings her fists at him, but not even her pluck can
          overcome the length of his limbs. Draven cocks his head to one side,
          clearly wondering what he’s got his hands on.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hey, why don’t you pick on someone your own size?” yells Lulu, aiming
          her staff towards Draven. Swirling fireworks ripple up and down its
          length, but Draven doesn’t look impressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Do your worst, shorty,” he says. “You ain’t got nothing can hurt
          Draven.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The fireworks shoot out of Lulu’s staff in a storm of light.
        </p>
        <p>And miss.</p>
        <p>Draven laughs, spinning his axe up.</p>
        <p>
          But then a tall shadow falls over him, and he slowly turns around.
        </p>
        <p>That’s when he realizes Lulu didn’t miss at all.</p>
        <p>
          The rabbit with the half-chewed ear looms over Draven, twice his
          height at least. It munches slowly on a carrot—a carrot that’s as long
          as Draven’s arm. He drops Tristana as the giant rabbit taps two stubby
          fingers of its paw to its eyes, then points them at Draven with a
          stern look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Draven is a warrior, and has fought his share of monsters, but this is
          too much even for him. He turns and sprints for the trees, pausing
          only to scoop up his other axe as he goes. The rest of the Noxians
          have already fled, or are backing away slowly into the undergrowth at
          the sight of the giant rabbit. Something tells me they will find a
          different route for their master’s army.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana turns to look at the rabbit with the half-chewed ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Thanks,” she says, but the rabbit doesn’t reply. Like I said, stoic.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns and makes its way back to its burrow in a series of thudding
          hops. By the time it reaches the entrance, it’s more or less returned
          to its normal size. It squeezes into the burrow with a final waggle of
          its tail and a puff of earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana slings Boomer over her shoulder. “Do you have your doodad?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu holds it up triumphantly. “My very <i>naughty</i> doodad.
          Shouldn’t run off like that!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Tristana shakes her head and marches back to the tree they fell out
          of. Lulu skips after her as Pix buzzes overhead, riding a pair of
          wasps with a tiny squeal of delight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu catches up with Tristana and waves her doodad at the tree in what
          might be a predetermined pattern, or might just be her hoping for the
          best. Whatever it is, it works, and the leafy arbor reappears in the
          silverbark’s trunk. Sunrise over the land of the yordles spills into
          my moonlit glade. I feel its ancient magic, and I send a pulse of my
          own through the air, wishing my two friends interesting travels.
        </p>
        <p>Lulu pauses and looks over her shoulder.</p>
        <p>
          “Thank you,” she says, and I feel the boundless joy in her heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beauty of my glade is made all the richer for it.
        </p>
        <p>“Come on, we should get going,” says Tristana.</p>
        <p>“Why are you in such a hurry?”</p>
        <p>“We should be gone before the Noxians return.”</p>
        <p>
          “I don’t think they’ll be coming back,” says Lulu with a wide grin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light of the portal swells outwards in a glowing, rippling spiral
          to envelop the yordles. Their forms blur, and their voices grow faint
          as they are drawn away once more. But I hear Tristana’s last words,
          and cold winds pass through the glade in a ripple of unease.
        </p>
        <p>
          “They’re Noxians,” she says. “They always come back.”
